# Introduction #
Browser Video Player provides a web video player interface that enables you to play video files stored on your browser.

The software is especially helpful on sites that require media to be played from a tab on the same browser window while screen sharing, such as during a Google Meet.

# Contribute #
The software is in its initial stage and in a very rudimentary form at this moment, but it's open-source and contributions are welcomed to improve it. With this software, you can enjoy a seamless and enjoyable video playback experience on your browser, but there's still room for development and improvement, adding more features and functionalities that are lacking in current browser built-in video players. So if you're looking for a better video player experience, give Browser Video Player a try and contribute to its development.
